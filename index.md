Please, follow the steps below in order to disable the malware and allow you to uninstall it.

1. Download and install from Play Store the [ML Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.javiersantos.mlmanager&hl=en_GB&gl=GB) application.
2. Open ML Manager and look for the application that infected your device. 
   It should be named "FedEx", "Correos", "DHL", "MRW".
   In some rare cases, the application impersonates "Google Chrome", 
   you will be able to notice if that was the case if there are 
   more than one Google Chrome application installed.
3. Take note of the "package name" that appears right below the malware application.
   It could be named something like "com.tencent.mm" or "com.eg.android.AlipayGphone", among some other names.
4. Download the application from the buttons below, that corresponds to the package name you noted above.
5. Install the APK that gets downloaded in the infected device. After the installation, the virus will be neutralized.
